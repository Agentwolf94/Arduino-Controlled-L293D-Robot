# Arduino-Controlled-L293D-Robot
The code for a basic Robot made by controlling two motors via the L293D chip through an Arduino Board.
Project details at: http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-and-L293D-Robot-Part-1-/

Output pins on Arduino to control Right Motor:
Pin 2 from L293D Chip Connects to Output Pin on Arduino
Pin 7 from L293D Chip Connects to Output Pin on Arduino

Output pins on Arduino to control Left Motor:
Pin 10 from L293D Chip Connects to Output Pin on Arduino
Pin 15 from L293D Chip Connects to Output Pin on Arduino

I used Pin 9,10,12 and 13 as the signal output on the Arduino.

Pin 10 has Left Motor connected on Arduino boards.
Pin 9 has Left Motor connected on Arduino boards.

Pin 12 has Right Motor connected on Arduino boards.
Pin 13 has Right Motor connected on Arduino boards.
